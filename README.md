# Web Server Architecture Script (WSAS)

WSAS keeps your data and server-side logic separate â€” unlike PHP. Designed to easily process [HTTP requests](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp) and perform routine (scheduled) actions. WSAS's implementation prevents any requests from being ignored (i.e. all requests recieve a response, even if it's just to tell them they made a 400 Bad Request).

Compiler written in OCaml which takes in a text file, tokenizes it, parses it to an AST, and interprets that tree to produce [node.js webserver code](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js/node-js-web-server/).

## Meta statements

The following are meta statements, which inform your server on how it should run. For tidiness, these should (but need not) be placed at the very top of your file.

```
hostname "localhost";
port 3000;
auto_serve_files_in "./your/path/here/";
```

- `hostname` is the IP of your server. This defaults to `localhost` if unspecified. Only one can be declared per program.
- `port` is the port of your server. This defaults to `3000` if unspecified. Only one can be declared per program.
- If `auto_serve_files_in` is set, any GET or HEAD requests for files within the path parameter will respond with the file if not handled by an `onrequest` function, rather than being treated as a 404 error (this is equivalent to implementing an `onrequest GET "<path>/()"` and `onrequest HEAD "<path>/()"` at the end of your WSAS file). Remember, all other file requests are treated as endpoints that must be manually processed by the programmer. `auto_serve_files_in` can be declared multiple times for as many paths as you wish.

## On Request functions

```
onrequest GET "(filename).html" {

  respond 200 as "text/html" with readfile("src/" + filename + ".html");
}

onrequest GET "/endpoint?value1=(msg)&value2=()" {

  if (msg == "I hate cats") {
    respond 404 as "text/plain" with "You can't say that!" log "User illegally said they hate cats.";
  }

  respond 200 as "text/plain" with "Cat here! You said " + msg;
}

onrequest GET "()" {

  respond 404 as "text/html" with replace(readfile("src/404.html"), "<message>", "Get request did not match any endpoint.") log "Get request did not match any endpoint.";
}
```

`(name)` in a request description is a wildcard that matches to a variable named `name`. You can also use `()` for a wildcard that doesn't need to be assigned to a variable.

If a request would be accepted by multiple `onrequest` functions, the topmost one is selected. If the request does not call `respond` by the time it exits that function, however, it continues searching for the next `onrequest` function that will accept it (if any). Any request that is not accepted and responded to by any `onrequest` function will automatically be responded to with `Error 400: Bad Request` (to avoid this, implement an `onrequest` function for every expected request). This ensures that all requests are responded to (i.e. no timeouts).

## On Schedule functions
